# Zip files for Telegram
As an amateur photographer, it's annoying to constantly have to deal with the memory limits of (free) cloud storage. As such, I prefer sending my friends photos over Telegram. However, Telegram has a 2GB file limit, which becomes annoying to work with when even after compression, the total size of all the photos taken is around 30-50GB. This works around that problem, grouping files together so that each group is less than 2GB. 
## How to use
Run in python 3, and follow the prompts in command line for input/output and maximum size. If maximum size is empty, default is 2GB.
